# Contribute

## Open

We follow the [contributor-covenant][contributor-covenant] and request that you do also.

Functional contributions and bug reports welcome, tests even more so.  Please follow these handy [guidelines][contribution-guidelines].

Please see the [section on building][about-building] as modifications will fail the build if they do not conform to formatting conventions 
(there's a Maven profile that trivially fixes this).


## Fork and be happy

You're free to fork the Git repository at [BitBucket][bitbucket-instrumental] or [GitHub][github-instrumental] for your own use and updates.

This project is actively maintained, please avoid fragmentation and contribute your fixes and new features back to the originating codebase 
using pull requests at [BitBucket][bitbucket-instrumental-pull] or [GitHub][github-instrumental-pull].


## Donations?

We don't accept cash or equivalent donations - but if you've enjoyed or benefited from this library
then please carry out a stealth [random act of kindness][random-act-of-kindness]
for someone/somewhere deserving.  Share the love.
