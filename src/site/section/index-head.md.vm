Instrumentation and dynamic programming tools, supporting JDK 8, 9 and 10.

Provides in-memory and on-disk support for compilation and archiving, proxing of classes and dynamic instrumentation.
  
See the module list and examples for more.

These modules are not quite ready for prime-time, until such time, SNAPSHOT artifacts will only be available (in Sontatype OSS repo). 

Due to various pains regarding multi-release JARs (Maven/Jacoco/Sonar lack of support), and no well-defined 
way to run tests against different JDKs in Maven - the build is currently dependent on JDK paths.
