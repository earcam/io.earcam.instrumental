`${project.artifactId}.Compiler`

* Convenience functionality on top of `javax.tools.JavaCompiler`  
* Compile to/from the file-system, or entirely in-memory (e.g. from source as `String` to class as `byte` array)  
* Fluid builder with specific support for [annotation processors][annotation-processor]
* Create native headers in arbitrary locations (in-mem/on-disk)
* Find sourcecode for classes within maven module or it's dependencies (on proviso that source jar has been downloaded)

Provides a complete in-memory _experience_:

* Using [instrumental.archive][instrumental-archive], via [instrumental.compile.glue][instrumental-compile-glue], compiler 
output can be added to an in-memory archive
* By using [instrumental.archive.glue][instrumental-archive-glue] in-memory archives may be used as the source of compiler 
dependencies (coupled with [instrumental.archive.maven](/archive.maven) to download Maven dependency graphs as compilation deps).


**Note**: currently the Eclipse compiler only supports input from the filesystem.
